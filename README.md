# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python-Tkinter
This is a Rock Paper Scissors Game with a Tkinter GUI made in Python as a starter project to help me learn the Python programming language.
It is a simple game that breaks when put into fullscreen, as I created this while still being new to the Tkinter Module.

The gameplay is quite simple, type in either "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" into the entrybox and the script will use the random module to randomly select their choice. The game makes use of a score save system, allowing the user to save their score to a .txt file and play again later, as well as the option to reset their save if they wish to.
